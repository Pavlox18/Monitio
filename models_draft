I am not adding fields like id because it should be clear that they are needed :)

User:
	char	name,
	char	surname,
	char	login,
	char	password

Calendar:
	char	calendarType,
	m2m	usersAssigned (user),
	date	createdDate,
	foreign	createdBy (user)

Item:
	foreign	calendar,
	m2m	concerns (user),
	date	beginDate,
	date	endDate,
	char	description,
	char	type (Event, Task, Note),
	date	createdDate,
	foreign	createdBy (user)
